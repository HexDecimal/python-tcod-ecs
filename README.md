# About

An experimental and work-in-progress ECS registry for implementing composition over inheritance.

# Installation

Use pip to install this library:
```
pip install tcod-ecs
```

If `tcod` is installed and the version is less than `14.0.0` then `import tcod.ec` will fail.
Remove or update `tcod` to fix this issue.
